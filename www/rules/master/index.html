  <h2 id="master-rules">Masterserver Rules</h2>
  <p>Some rules has been directly adopted from teeworlds.com:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Modified servers should not use standard gametypes (i.e. DM, TDM, CTF, LMS, LTS).</li>
    <li>The player count shown should accurately reflect the number of human players. The maximum player count must indicate the total number of human players that can join.</li>
    <li>Do not host an excessive amount of servers. There is no fixed limit but try to not overdo it. (i.e. there should be people playing on them eventually)</li>
    <li>Do not host servers purely for advertising purposes (e.g. password-protected servers just for ads). However, including sponsor information or similar details in the server name is fine.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Additionally, the following rules apply:</p>
  <ol start="5">
    <li>The Server should be joinable via the latest version of the official DDNet client, not requiring a custom client.</li>
    <li>Servers should not have content we consider inappropiate, like maps containing human nudity.</li>
    <li>Do not host public servers that encourage or facilitate cheating, including servers meant exclusively for TAS runs.</li>
    <li>Server names should be unique and should not impersonate or duplicate existing servers.</li>
    <li>If the server requires account creation and login to play, the <code>requires_login</code> property must be set to <code>true</code> (refer to <a href="https://github.com/ddnet/ddnet/blob/282ea709427b2569ffc66422b8c04b28a9708f9a/src/engine/server/server.cpp#L2507">server.cpp</a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This list is not <strong>exhaustive</strong>. Additional rules may be applied <strong>retroactively</strong> at our discretion, including banning servers that violate the spirit of fair play or good conduct.</p>
  <p>You can check out the list of Teeworlds master server bans at <a href="https://teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg">https://teeworlds.com/master-bans.cfg</a>. If you wish to be notified about issues with your server, provide a contact email address in your MOTD or contact us on the official <a href="/discord/">Discord</a> server.</p>
